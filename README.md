# Embodied-Conversational-Agent
Project in the scope of the Artificial Intelligence Bachelor study at JKU Linz.

This Project aims at programming an Embodied Conversational Agent for Game Analysis.
As a programming language, it will use primarily Python, but I might consider using html and css in the progress.

Progress updates on this project will be presented roughly every three weeks on the JKU campus.
Contents of the first presentation on November 10 will be:
* a rough sketch of the framework
* ideas and plans
* a to-do list which covers the main functions of the programm

Until then the strategy will be to read up on literature and gather ideas and a more concrete concept.
