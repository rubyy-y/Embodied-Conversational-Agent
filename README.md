# Embodied-Conversational-Agent
Project in the scope of the Artificial Intelligence Bachelor study at JKU Linz.

This Project aims at programming an Embodied Conversational Agent for Game Analysis.
As a programming language, it will use primarily Python, but I might consider using html and css in the progress.

Progress updates on this project will be presented roughly every three weeks on the JKU campus.
