# idea of this file: handle arias tags after get response in app.py call
# maybe functions could return html divisions inside base.html

# user data - name, id, level, progress

# static widgets - score, scorePerMin, scorePerMatch, wins, topk,
#                  kills, killsPerMin, killsPerMatch, deaths, kd,
#                  matches, winRate, minutesPlayed, playersOutlived // all of these are also intent tags
